    How does the game work?

    1. There are two players: you and the machine.
    2. A board of 10 x 10 positions where the ships will be placed.
    3. The first thing you do is to place the ships. For this game the ships are placed randomly, and ships cannot touch each other (not even diagonally).
       The ships are:
        * 4 ships of 1 length position.
        * 3 ships of 2 positions of length
        * 2 boats of 3 positions of length
        * 1 boat of 4 length positions   
    4. Both you and the machine have a board with boats, and the goal is to "shoot" and sink the opponent's boats until one player runs out of boats,
       and therefore loses.
    5. It works by turns and a coin is flipped to decide who starts.
    6. In each turn you shoot at a coordinate (X, Y) of the opponent's board. If you hit, it's your turn again. Otherwise, it is the machine's turn.
    7. In the machine's turns, if it hits, it's its turn again. Where does the machine shoot? The machine shoots randomly, unless it already hit a boat.
       In this case it will shoot close to the already hit boat to try to sink it. Moreover, the machine won't shoot close to already sunk boats,
       as the game rules don't allow you to put boats there.
    8. If all the ships of one player are sunk, the game ends and the other player wins.
